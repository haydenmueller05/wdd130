                        remember when i first started and I felt so lost and I felt like coding was so confusing and so broad. I didnt know where to start, So I want
                        this website to help those know where to start and how to start their own coding career. This website will have my projects, experiences, blog,
                        and things that ive gone through to get here. I know the hardest part about getting into a coding career is starting, I want to help others know 
                        how to start.

                    <p>My name is Heather Mueller the mother of Hayden Mueller. Over the last few years Hayden has shown great leadership skills and great work ethic.
                        Hayden is a thoughtful and empathic individual who always cares for those who he surrounds himself with. Hayden is very talented especially when it comes to coding, designing and computers. I recently asked if he could design a logo for our short-term rental business that we just started. I gave him an idea of what I was looking for and he created a perfect logo that will work well for our business. I needed a few slight changes to it and he listened to what I wanted which is an important part of designing the logo. To say that I am proud of him is an understatement. I would recommend Hayden to any position or opportunity; he has the skillset to figure things out to get the job done.</p>
